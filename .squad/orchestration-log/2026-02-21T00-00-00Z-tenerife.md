# Orchestration Log: Tenerife (2026-02-21T00:00:00Z)

## Agent
**Name:** Tenerife  
**Role:** Rules Expert  
**Status:** Completed

## Task
Define Milestone 1 "Base Game Fully Working" scope with comprehensive mechanics, win/loss conditions, and rule clarifications.

## Actions Taken
1. Defined core game loop:
   - Roll → Assign (alternating turns) → Resolve (module order fixed) → Advance altitude → Repeat

2. Specified all 7 modules (MUST-have):
   - Axis: Balance check ([-2, 2])
   - Engines: Thrust accumulation (≥9 to land)
   - Brakes: Descent control (≥6 to land)
   - Flaps: Deployment (≥4 to land)
   - Landing Gear: Binary deployment required
   - Radio: Plane clearance from Approach track
   - Concentration: Wildcard flexible boost (post-assignment)

3. Documented altitude track (7 segments, 6000→0 ft):
   - Reroll tokens at segments 1 & 5
   - Player alternates after each descent

4. Documented approach track (Montreal airport):
   - 7 segments with [0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2] planes per segment
   - Radio module clears planes

5. Defined 6 landing criteria (all must pass):
   - Axis balanced, Engines ≥9, Brakes ≥6, Flaps ≥4, Gear deployed, Approach clear

6. Clarified rule ambiguities:
   - Concentration: post-assignment allocation (recommended)
   - Radio: simultaneous resolution, sum-then-clear (recommended)
   - Reroll: exactly 1 token per game, up to 2 dice per use (official)
   - Accumulation: Axis/Engines/Brakes all cumulative (assumed, needs confirmation)

7. Provided 12 vertical-slice acceptance criteria for backlog

## Artifacts
- Comprehensive M1 scope spec (`.squad/decisions/inbox/tenerife-m1-scope.md`)
- 12 backlog issue templates with acceptance criteria
- DDD aggregate guidance
- Testing priority roadmap
- Risk flagging (Concentration complexity)

## Next Steps
- Skiles: Implement GameState + ExecuteCommand dispatcher (Phase 1)
- Aloha: Prepare test harness for module implementations
- Team: Execute Phase 1 concurrently
