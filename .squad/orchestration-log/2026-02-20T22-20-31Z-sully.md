## Agent
**Name:** Sully  
**Role:** Architect  
**Status:** Completed

## Task
Establish GitHub backlog with color-coded labels and vertical-slice issues for Milestone 1.

## Actions Taken
1. Created 25 GitHub labels across 5 categories:
   - **Type** (Purple): domain, module, command, test, infra
   - **Priority** (Red/Orange/Yellow/Green): critical, high, medium, low
   - **Status** (Green/Pink/Blue): ready, blocked, review
   - **Area** (Dark Green): game-aggregate, axis, engines, brakes, flaps, landing-gear, radio, concentration
   - **Routing** (Lavender): sully, skiles, tenerife, aloha

2. Created 14 M1 issues with labels and dependency links:
   - #1–2: Foundation (Game init, Round advancement)
   - #3–9: Core modules (Axis through Concentration)
   - #10–11: Execution & Win/Loss
   - #12–13: Tests
   - #14: Rules clarification (single source of truth)

3. Established dependency graph:
   - Rules (#14) → Module implementation (#3–9)
   - Foundation (#1–2) → ExecuteCommand (#10) → Win/Loss (#11)
   - All → Test coverage (#12–13)

## Artifacts
- GitHub issues #1–#14 (all linked with dependency metadata)
- 25 labels visible in repository
- Milestones M1–M4 created

## Next Steps
- Tenerife: Complete #14 (rules documentation)
- Team: Parallelize module work once rules finalized
