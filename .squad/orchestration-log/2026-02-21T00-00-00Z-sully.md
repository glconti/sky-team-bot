# Orchestration: Sully — Telegram Architecture + Concentration Token Assessment

**Agent:** Sully (Architect)  
**Timestamp:** 2026-02-21T13:00:01Z  
**Status:** Complete

## Output
- Assessed secret placement and coffee token UX fit against DDD aggregate pattern
- Produced architectural guidance: Minimal interaction contract between Telegram bot and domain
- Proposed token command model (Option A: spend as parameter on PlaceDieCommand)
- Appended findings to `.squad/decisions.md`

## Decisions Made
1. **Secret Placement Architecture:** Excellent fit with existing DDD game aggregate; no public infrastructure changes required
2. **Token Command Model:** Option A (Recommended) — Token spend as parameter, not separate command; prevents ordering ambiguity
3. **Module Resolution Order:** Land on Concentration → Gain token → Advance (locked to prevent race conditions)
4. **Telegram Contract:** Ephemeral UI (private keyboards), readiness handling, reveal broadcasting; domain stays UI-agnostic

## Dependencies Resolved
- ✅ Skiles has clear command shape for PlaceDieOnConcentration (with spend parameters)
- ✅ Aloha can test secret storage assumptions per architecture
- ✅ Implementation team knows UI-domain boundary and can build in parallel

## Next Steps
- Skiles: Integrate CoffeeTokenPool into GameState per architecture contract
- Aloha: Test secret placement + token spend flows
- Cross-check: Code review of GameState aggregate when Phase 1 complete
