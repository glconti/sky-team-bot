# Orchestration Log: Skiles (2026-02-21T00:00:00Z)

## Agent
**Name:** Skiles  
**Role:** Implementation Lead  
**Status:** Completed

## Task
Audit current codebase, identify Milestone 1 blockers, and propose work breakdown.

## Actions Taken
1. Performed codebase audit:
   - ✅ Working: Die (1–6), BlueDie/OrangeDie, Altitude (7-segment), Airport (Montreal), PathSegment, AltitudeSegment, GameModule interface
   - ✅ Tested: 19 unit tests all passing (randomness, progression, state)
   - ❌ Missing: GameState aggregate, ExecuteCommand dispatcher, 5+ module implementations, win/loss conditions

2. Identified critical blockers:
   - **GameState aggregate:** Missing class; tests reference it but it doesn't exist → blocks all game flow
   - **ExecuteCommand dispatcher:** Empty stub; cannot route commands to modules
   - **Command implementations:** AxisPositionModule command constructors throw NotImplementedException
   - **Module implementations:** Engines, Brakes, Flaps, LandingGear, Radio, Concentration not started

3. Proposed 4-phase work breakdown:
   - **Phase 1 (Foundation):** GameState aggregate + ExecuteCommand dispatcher routing (1–2 hours)
   - **Phase 2 (First modules):** Engines + Brakes with Tenerife-approved rules (parallelizable)
   - **Phase 3 (Round flow):** Win/loss conditions, landing validation, reroll mechanics
   - **Phase 4 (Remaining modules):** Flaps, LandingGear, Radio, Concentration

4. Flagged architectural concerns:
   - Game class mixes aggregate + command orchestration (refactor with GameState)
   - AxisPositionModule design closure needed (die parameter vs. module closure)
   - Non-deterministic Die.Roll() acceptable for now but future issue if many games

## Artifacts
- Current state assessment (`.squad/decisions/inbox/skiles-current-state-2026-02-21.md`)
- Detailed risk flags and architectural observations
- Phase-based work breakdown with estimated effort
- Dependency graph identifying Phase 1 as blocker

## Next Steps
- Start Phase 1: GameState class + ExecuteCommand routing (1–2 hours)
- Await Tenerife rules clarification for Phase 2 module details
- Parallel: Aloha prepares test harness for module implementations
